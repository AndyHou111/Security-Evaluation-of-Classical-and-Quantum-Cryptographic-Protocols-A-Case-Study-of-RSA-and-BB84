# Security-Evaluation-of-Classical-and-Quantum-Cryptographic-Protocols-A-Case-Study-of-RSA-and-BB84
This project contains python codes for the experiments in the paper "Security Evaluation of Classical and Quantum Cryptographic Protocols: A Case Study of RSA and BB84"

There are five relevant python projects in total: 
1) AES_BB84.py: This project simulates using AES algorithm and BB84 protocol to achieve encrypted communications.
2) Shor's_Algorithm_Simulation.py: This project simulates using Shor's Algorithm to factorize a small number private key (e.g. 15 = 3 * 5) in RSA.
3) Time_Prediction.py: This contains codes for the first experiment in the paper, which discusses the time prediction for Shor's Algorithm to break RSA.
4) BB84_Security.py: This is the second experiment in the paper, showing the eavesdropping cases in the BB84 protocol.
5) BB84_Application_Security_Simulation.py: This is the third experiment in the paper, which estimates QBER for three different QKD channels. 

These codes provide a thorough security analysis of RSA and BB84 and visualize the experimental results in the paper, helping reader to better understand the experimental processes and results.
